The dpl script Travis uses to deploy and do build verification is currently broken. If you are getting a persistent missing bucket_name error with a failed build you will need to add the following to your .travis.yml file:

deploy:
  edge: true
  provider: elasticbeanstalk
  ...
What this is doing is forcing Travis to use the v2 (experimental) version of the dpl script which does not have the bug.


The code will now look like this:

access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_KEY
